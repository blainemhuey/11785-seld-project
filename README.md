# 11-785 Introduction to Deep Learning Final Project: 

## Code Organization

Below is the purpose and summarized contents of each Python file in the repository (last updated April 27, 2022)

- "SELDNetwork.py":
  - Baseline model architecture written in PyTorch
  - Note: the repository also contains an earlier one of our group's implementations of SELDNet in the file "seldnet.py"
    - TODO: Remove old code?
- "d3net.py": Contains the PyTorch code for D2Blocks, D3Blocks, and RD3Net
- "evaluation.py": Code
  - Note: the repository also contains an earlier F-score and Error metric implementation that could not accomodate Multi-ACCDOA in the file "temp_eval.py"
    - TODO: Remove old code?
- "foa_dataset.py": Main DCASE 2022 Dataset Reader and Feature Extractor
- "local_multpath_learning.py": Implementation of Local Multi-path Blocks
- "loss.py": Implementation of ADPIT-Loss Function
- "SELD_Notebook.ipynb": Jupyter Notebook for running tests

## Instructions to Run

For testing purposes, we have run many of our experiments in the Jupyter Notebook mentioned above

TODO: Write easy-to-execute main python file with all tests?
